# RobloxMultiInstance
A multi instance thingy designed for Roblox.

Hello all, I made this in like 10 minutes using [someones old script from 2023.](https://github.com/MiningTcup/Roblox-Multi-Instance/) 

I'm not the best at stuff like this but with the help of some tutorials, it somehow worked.

**I'm muted in bloxstrap right now, so uh**

Below is an example of what you can do with this.
